            <p>So you want to host a weight loss competition?  Great, I want to tell you how.</p>

            <p>It should be so easy, just gather up your heavyset friends, a notebook to track weights, and a scale.  How hard can this be? </p>
            
            <br/> <p class='bold'>Really Hard</p><br/>
            
            <p>Any time you are trying to coordinate more people than just yourself complications arise.  And complications make competitions no fun, especially for the host of the competition.</p>

            <h3 class=heading>Before You Round Up Your Friends</h3>

            <p>Before you go recruiting your friends to join the competition there are a couple of things that you should understand from the outset.</p>
            
            <h5>Pounds lost are not comparable across all participants </h5>
            
            <p>You can’t simply compare the number of pounds that each competitor loses to establish the winner of your contest.  Imagine if you will; Jim who weighs 250 pounds is competing against Sue who weights 140 pounds, if Jim loses 10 pounds during the competition and Sue loses 9, it is tempting to conclude that Jim is winner.  He did after all lose more weight.  </p>
            
            <p>This is not a fair comparison, however.  Because Jim is significantly heavier than Sue you must convert the weight that each lost to a % of bodyweight.  When you do this you see that Jim lost 4.0% (10lbs / 250lbs) while Sue lost 6.4% (9lbs / 140lbs).  When looked at from the standpoint of a percentage of bodyweight it is obvious that Sue did a much better job of shedding the weight than Jim.</p>
            
            <h5>Scales must be consistent</h5>

            <p>As someone who was not used to weighing themselves prior to getting involved with weight loss competitions, I was shocked to see how much of a difference can exist between two different scales.  It isn’t uncommon to see a discrepancy of 4-5 lbs. between normal Walmart grade scales. </p> 
            
            <p>Because of the inherent inaccuracy of cheap household scales, it is very important that all participants weigh in on the same scale each week.  If they do this, even though their true weight may be off, the amount of weight that they lost should be pretty close to spot on.</p>
            
            <h5>Your friends will forget to weigh in</h5>
            
            <p>Any weight loss competition worth its salt will take place over a number of weeks (if not months).  Because of the extended time frames (and the number of people involved) you will inevitably have participants that forget to weigh in.</p>  
            
            <p>This forgetfulness can be a major demotivator for other participants who want to see where they stand.  As the host of the competition you must take it upon yourself to ensure all participants know when the need to weigh in and how to record their weights.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="blockquote indent">As you may or may not know, we host a completely free weight loss competition app that takes care of all of the administrative hassles of hosting a weight loss competition.  If you are truly interested in being a host, you should really check it out at <a href='www.flippingthescales.com'>www.flippingthescales.com</a>.  There is a video right on the homepage that explains exactly how it works in 60 seconds.</blockquote>

            <h3>Getting Your Competition Started</h3>
            
            <p>It's time to begin recruiting participants.  According to <a href='http://time.com/5334532/weight-loss-americans/'>Time</a> about half of Americans are trying to lose weight at any point in time.  So finding friends and family that might be interested shouldn't be too hard.  The difficult part is how to recruit people with tact.  Popping in on cousin Lisa and telling her she needs to lose some weight and that your weight loss competition is the way to do it may not be recieved as gratefully as you hope.</p>
            
            <p>The good news is that as long as you don't imply your friends/family need to lose weight, they will typically be receptive to joining in the fun.  In fact, I've typically had success just letting people know that I was organizing a Biggest Loser style competition (like the TV show) and people will ask if they can join.</p>

            <h5>The Competition Details</h5>

            <p>When your hosting, it's typically a good idea to have an outline for the details of your competition before you start recruiting.  It allows you to give concrete answers to first questions every participant will want to know:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>How much is it to enter?</li>
              <li>How long will it run for?</li>
              <li>How much can I win?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Let's dive into each of these questions.</p>

            <p><span class='bold'>Entry Fee</span> - When your thinking about what to set your entry fee, the main thing to keep in mind is what amount will keep participants motivated over the whole period.  I see a lot of folks error on the low side and set an entry fee of $5 or so.  As the host, this is tempting because you don't have to worry about scaring off your participants because of a high fee.  The problem with this strategy is that when the total prize pool is only $25 to $50 there won't be enough financial incentive to change the participants behavior especially over many many weeks.</p>

            <p><span class='bold'>Competition Length</span> - This one is a bit trickier.  There are two dynamics  that need to be weighed against each other when selecting the competition length.  One, longer competitions can lead to more weightloss (generally a good thing) and two longer competitions lead to participant burnout (definately a bad thing).</p>  
            
            <p>The way I like to make the decision is to look at the participants who need to lose the <span class='bold'>least</span> and estimate what their % of weight loss would be to get them to their goal weight.  For instance, if Sue weighs 150 pounds and wants to weigh 130 pounds then she needs to lose 20 pounds or about 13% of her current bodyweight.  I will set the number of weeks close to that percentage, so about 12-13 weeks.  By setting the length for the competitor with the least to lose, you ensure that one competitor won't be sitting around for weeks at their goal weight while everyone else keeps losing.</p>

            <p><span class='bold'>Prizes</span> How much a participant can win is determined by 3 factors, how many participants enter, how much the entry fee is, and how prizes are awarded.  Obviously, you can manipulate the prize by pulling on any of these levers.  The easiest lever to pull, however, is usually how the prizes are awarded.</p> 
            
            <p>In the most basic competition, all of the prize money will be awarded to the first place participant.  I like this methodology because it's easy to understand and maximizes the incentive to lose the most weight.  The problem is, that if one member of the competition begins to pull away from the rest of the competitors then the prize feels out of reach for everyone else.  To avoid this problem I recommend adding an extra prize for every 6-8 participants (i.e. if there are 7 participants have two prizes and if there are 14 prizes have 3).</p>

            <p>One final consideration is whether or not to award interim prizes based on some criteria over shorter time frames.  A good example is awarding 5% of the prize pool every two weeks to the participant with the highest % weight loss over that period.  This can be a good approach to keep up motivation for the entire competition, but it can lead to complicated tracking.</p>

            <h5>Final Considerations</h5>

            <p>I want to review a couple of related items that will almost certainly need to be considered.</p>

            <p><span class='bold'>First, frequency of weigh-ins:</span> While not everyone agrees, I am a big fan of daily weigh-ins.  Over a period of a couple of months it provides a lot of feedback into what drives body weight changes and allows participants to get a much clearer look into how their body is changing.  Weight can fluctuate pretty significantly on a day to day basis (1-2 pounds is pretty typical), so relying on a single weekly weigh-in can crush motivation if you happen to hit a bad day.</p>

            <p><span class='bold'>Second, group weigh-ins:</span> No one would argue that group weigh-ins are ideal, having the peer pressure of your friends looking on live at your progress can be a huge motivator.  However, it is very rarely practical.  Unless you are competing with your office mates, it is pretty unlikely that everyone in the competition will be together in person each week without significant strain.  I think it is completly fine to allow participants to weigh-in on their own (these are your friends after all), but remember that everyone should use the same scale for every weigh-in.</p>

            <p><span class='bold'>Thrid, sensitivity to seeing actual weights:</span> You may have some participants that are sensitive to giving their actual weight and would prefer instead to just provide their % weight loss.  This can obviously be a challenge logistically, but it is something that I think should be allowed if your family/friends feel strongly about it.</p>

            <h5>Tools for Success</h5>

            <p>I've reviewed a bunch of the most important aspects of creating and hosting a Biggest Loser style weight loss competition for you and your friends.  But one thing I havn't mentioned are the fact that there are tools to make the task of host much much easier.  One free tool is our 100% free weight-loss competition app <a href="FlippingTheScales.com">FlippingTheScales.com</a>.  This app allows you to create a competition, invite your friends, track % weight loss for each participants, and track the prizes that are awarded.  It will even send reminders to participants when they need to weigh in.  If you are considering hosting a weight-loss competition you should really consider using it.  I've included a video below that shows how it work.</p>
